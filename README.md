# Sudoku Solver

## Purpose
This is just an exercise project to get some hands on experience with Python.

## Prerequisites
The Sudoku Solver runs with Python 3. (I'm using `Python 3.10.4 (v3.10.4:9d38120e33, Mar 23 2022, 17:29:05) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin`)

## How to run
To run the program:
1. Go to the `sudoku` folder, 
2. Type `python3 sudoku.py`. You will be presented a menu, which is self-explanatory. Just follow the instructions ;)

(Or ... you could run it from your favourite IDE. I'm using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).)

## Notes
I run my tests inside [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), which works like a charm. I have not succeeded running them from the commandline, however. Not yet.
